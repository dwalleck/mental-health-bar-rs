# New Features

## New UI layout and design

- Based on catalyst-ui-kit
- Keep svelte, create svelte components or just use tailwindcss styling
- upgrade to tailwind4

## Activity Groups

I want to create a two level heirarchy of activities:

- Activity Group: A name of a group of activities that could fufil a goal or habit the user is trying to meet (ex: Exercise)
- Activities: One to one relationship with Activity Groups (ex: hiking, swiming)

When it comes to reporting, we
will say how many days a week they did the activity or activity group and the percent change from the previous week.

A user should be able to set a goal for any activity in an activity group, or a specific activity. Goals can be x number of days in y period or x percent improvement over a y day period

### Daily Check In

- Should now be a scale of 1 - 7
- Should show all activities grouped by activity group
- Activities should have an icon instead of a name
