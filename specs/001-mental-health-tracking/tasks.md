# Tasks: Mental Health Assessment and Tracking Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mental-health-tracking/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD is MANDATORY per project constitution (Principle IX). Tests written ‚Üí user approved ‚Üí tests fail ‚Üí implement.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend (Rust)**: `src-tauri/src/`
- **Frontend (Svelte)**: `src/`
- **Tests**: `src-tauri/tests/` (Rust), `tests/` (Svelte/Vitest)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
  - User Story 2 (P2): No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
  - User Story 3 (P2): No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ (though US2 uses activities)
  - User Story 4 (P3): Requires US1 data (assessments) to visualize
  - User Story 5 (P3): Requires US2 data (mood check-ins) to visualize
  - User Story 6 (P3): Uses US1 (schedules assessments) but independently testable
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies Graph

Phase 2: Foundational
       ‚Üì
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

    ‚Üì     ‚Üì
    ‚Üì     ‚Üì
  US4   US5
  (P3)  (P3)
```

**Execution Order**:
1. **Sequential (MVP-first)**: Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US6 ‚Üí Polish
2. **Parallel (if team capacity)**: After Phase 2, US1/US2/US3/US6 can start in parallel, then US4/US5 after data exists

### Within Each User Story

**TDD Workflow (MANDATORY per Constitution Principle IX)**:
1. **Tests First**: Write all test tasks for story
2. **User Approval**: Review tests with user/stakeholder
3. **Verify Fail**: Run tests, confirm they fail (no implementation yet)
4. **Implement**: Execute implementation tasks
5. **Verify Pass**: Run tests, confirm they pass
6. **Checkpoint**: Verify story works independently

**Task Order**:
- Tests (T0XX) ‚Üí Models (T0XX) ‚Üí Repository (T0XX) ‚Üí Commands (T0XX) ‚Üí Frontend Components (T0XX) ‚Üí Routes (T0XX) ‚Üí Integration

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004, T005, T007 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T012, T013, T014, T015, T017, T019, T020 can run in parallel after database setup

**Within Each User Story**:
- All test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All model tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All repository tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All frontend component tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

**Across User Stories** (after Phase 2):
- US1, US2, US3, US6 can be developed in parallel by different team members
- US4 waits for US1 completion (needs assessment data)
- US5 waits for US2 completion (needs mood data)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Phase 1: Launch all tests together (TDD - write first):
Task: "Unit test: PHQ-9 scoring algorithm in src-tauri/src/features/assessments/models.rs"
Task: "Unit test: GAD-7 scoring algorithm in src-tauri/src/features/assessments/models.rs"
Task: "Unit test: CES-D scoring algorithm in src-tauri/src/features/assessments/models.rs"

Task: "Unit test: Severity level calculation in src-tauri/src/features/assessments/models.rs"
Task: "Component test: AssessmentForm in tests/unit/AssessmentForm.test.ts"

# Phase 2: Verify tests fail, then launch all models together:
Task: "Create AssessmentType model in src-tauri/src/features/assessments/models.rs"
Task: "Create AssessmentResponse model in src-tauri/src/features/assessments/models.rs"
Task: "Create AssessmentQuestion model in src-tauri/src/features/assessments/models.rs"

# Phase 4: Launch repository methods together:
Task: "Create AssessmentRepository in src-tauri/src/features/assessments/repository.rs"
Task: "Implement get_assessment_types query in repository"
Task: "Implement get_assessment_history query in repository"
Task: "Implement get_assessment_response query in repository"

# Phase 5: Launch frontend components together:
Task: "Create AssessmentList component in src/lib/components/assessments/AssessmentList.svelte"

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Goal**: Ship a working PHQ-9/GAD-7/CES-D/OASIS assessment tool in 2-3 days

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (~2 hours)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~4 hours) - CRITICAL PATH
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (~1-2 days with TDD)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Run all US1 tests (should pass 100%)
   - Complete PHQ-9 assessment end-to-end
   - Verify score calculation matches published guidelines
   - Test on Linux/macOS/Windows
5. **Deploy/Demo MVP** - working clinical assessment tool!

**Deliverables**: Users can take validated mental health assessments and see their scores

### Incremental Delivery

**Week 1**: MVP (US1) ‚Üí Assessment tool
**Week 2**: Add US2 + US3 ‚Üí Mood tracking with activities
**Week 3**: Add US4 + US5 ‚Üí Data visualization
**Week 4**: Add US6 ‚Üí Scheduling + reminders
**Week 5**: Polish ‚Üí Production-ready v0.1.0

Each increment:
- Adds user value
- Is independently testable
- Doesn't break previous features
- Can be demoed/deployed

### Parallel Team Strategy

**With 3 developers**:

**Phase 1-2** (All together):
- Dev A: Database setup (T008-T012)
- Dev B: Error handling + config (T013-T015)
- Dev C: Frontend layout + UI components (T019-T020)

**Phase 3+** (Parallel):
- Dev A: User Story 1 (Assessments) - Priority P1 üéØ
- Dev B: User Story 2 + 3 (Mood + Activities) - Priority P2
- Dev C: User Story 4 + 5 (Visualization) - Priority P3

**Integration**: Each dev's story is independently testable, minimal merge conflicts due to vertical slice architecture

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story] labels** = Map task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD MANDATORY**: Constitution Principle IX requires tests written first
- **Test Order**: Write ‚Üí User approve ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Pass ‚Üí Checkpoint
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group of [P] tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution Principle I: Ship US1 first, get feedback, iterate to US2/US3/etc.
- Constitution Principle III: Make it work (MVP) ‚Üí Make it right (refactor) ‚Üí Make it fast (optimize)

---
