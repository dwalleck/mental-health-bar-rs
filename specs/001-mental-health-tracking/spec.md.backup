# Feature Specification: Mental Health Assessment and Tracking Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-mental-health-tracking`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create an application that lets the user take the PHQ-9, Beck Depression Inventory, GAD-7, and Beck Anxiety Inventory depression and anxiety assessments on a configurable, periodic basis and track their scores. I would also like users to be able to check in multiple times per day and rate their mood on a scale of 1-5, as well as identify any activities the user has been doing. Activities should be creatable by the user. I would like to be able to visualize the depression and anxiety assessment scores as well as mood scores in charts."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Clinical Assessment (Priority: P1)

A user wants to complete a standardized mental health assessment (PHQ-9, Beck Depression Inventory, GAD-7, or Beck Anxiety Inventory) to track their mental health status over time. They need to take these assessments periodically to monitor changes and trends.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the application - providing standardized, validated mental health assessments that users and healthcare providers can trust. Without this, the application has no clinical foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading an assessment, answering all questions, submitting responses, and receiving a calculated score. Delivers immediate value by providing a standardized mental health screening result.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the application, **When** they select an assessment type (PHQ-9, BDI, GAD-7, or BAI), **Then** they see all questions for that assessment presented clearly
2. **Given** a user is viewing an assessment, **When** they answer all required questions and submit, **Then** their responses are saved and a total score is calculated according to the assessment's scoring guidelines
3. **Given** a user has completed an assessment, **When** they view their results, **Then** they see their total score, the date completed, and interpretation guidance based on standard clinical thresholds
4. **Given** a user has a recurring assessment scheduled, **When** the scheduled time arrives, **Then** they receive a notification to complete the assessment

### User Story 2 - Quick Daily Mood Check-In (Priority: P2)

A user wants to quickly log their current mood state multiple times throughout the day without the burden of completing a full assessment. They can rate their mood on a simple 1-5 scale and optionally note activities they've been doing.

**Why this priority**: Daily mood tracking provides granular data between formal assessments, helping users identify patterns and triggers. It's a lightweight engagement mechanism that encourages regular app usage.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the check-in feature, selecting a mood rating (1-5), optionally selecting activities, submitting the check-in, and verifying it's saved with a timestamp. Delivers value by creating a mood journal with minimal effort.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to log their current mood, **When** they open the check-in feature, **Then** they see a simple interface to rate mood from 1-5 with clear labels (e.g., 1=Very Low, 5=Very High)
2. **Given** a user is logging a mood check-in, **When** they select their mood rating, **Then** they can optionally select one or more activities from their activity list
3. **Given** a user completes a mood check-in, **When** they submit it, **Then** the check-in is saved with the current date and time, mood rating, and selected activities
4. **Given** a user has completed multiple check-ins in a day, **When** they review their history, **Then** they see all check-ins for that day with timestamps

---

### User Story 3 - Manage Personal Activities (Priority: P2)

A user wants to create and manage a personalized list of activities they engage in (e.g., "exercise", "meditation", "socializing", "work") so they can track which activities correlate with their mood states.

**Why this priority**: Activity tracking enables users to identify patterns between behaviors and mood states, supporting self-awareness and informed decisions about lifestyle changes. This is foundational for mood check-ins to be meaningful.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating new activities, editing activity names, deleting activities, and verifying they appear in the mood check-in interface. Delivers value by enabling personalized activity tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to track a new activity, **When** they access the activity management interface, **Then** they can create a new activity with a custom name
2. **Given** a user has created activities, **When** they view their activity list, **Then** they see all activities they've created in an organized list
3. **Given** a user wants to modify an activity, **When** they select an existing activity, **Then** they can edit its name or delete it
4. **Given** a user deletes an activity, **When** they view past check-ins that referenced that activity, **Then** those check-ins still show the deleted activity name (data integrity preserved)

---

### User Story 4 - Visualize Assessment Trends (Priority: P3)

A user wants to see their assessment scores over time displayed in charts to quickly understand trends in their depression and anxiety levels and share insights with healthcare providers.

**Why this priority**: Visualization makes data actionable by revealing patterns that aren't obvious in raw numbers. This supports clinical decision-making and user self-management.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing multiple assessments over time and viewing charts that plot scores chronologically. Delivers value by making trends immediately apparent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has completed multiple assessments of the same type, **When** they view the chart for that assessment, **Then** they see a line graph plotting their scores over time with dates on the x-axis and scores on the y-axis
2. **Given** a user views an assessment chart, **When** they examine the visualization, **Then** clinical threshold lines are displayed (e.g., mild/moderate/severe boundaries) to contextualize their scores
3. **Given** a user has taken different assessment types, **When** they access the visualization feature, **Then** they can select which assessment type to view (PHQ-9, BDI, GAD-7, or BAI)
4. **Given** a user wants to understand a specific data point, **When** they interact with a point on the chart, **Then** they see the exact score and date for that assessment

---

### User Story 5 - Visualize Daily Mood Patterns (Priority: P3)

A user wants to see their mood check-in data visualized over time to identify patterns in their daily mood fluctuations and correlations with activities.

**Why this priority**: Mood visualization helps users recognize patterns (e.g., time of day effects, activity correlations) that inform behavior changes and treatment discussions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging multiple mood check-ins over several days and viewing charts that display mood trends. Delivers value by revealing daily and weekly mood patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has logged multiple mood check-ins, **When** they view the mood chart, **Then** they see a visualization of their mood ratings over time (e.g., line chart or bar chart)
2. **Given** a user views their mood chart, **When** they select a time range (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days), **Then** the chart updates to show only data from that period
3. **Given** a user wants to understand activity correlations, **When** they view mood data with activities, **Then** they can see which activities were logged alongside specific mood ratings
4. **Given** a user has multiple check-ins in one day, **When** viewing the chart, **Then** all check-ins for that day are displayed to show intra-day mood variation

---

### User Story 6 - Configure Assessment Schedules (Priority: P3)

A user wants to set up recurring schedules for assessments (e.g., weekly PHQ-9, bi-weekly GAD-7) so they're reminded to complete assessments at appropriate intervals for clinical monitoring.

**Why this priority**: Regular assessment intervals are clinically important for tracking treatment progress, but this is a supporting feature that enhances the core assessment functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a schedule for an assessment, waiting for or simulating the scheduled time, receiving a reminder, and verifying the schedule persists. Delivers value by automating assessment cadence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to establish a regular assessment routine, **When** they access schedule settings, **Then** they can set up a recurring schedule for each assessment type with customizable frequency (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
2. **Given** a user has configured an assessment schedule, **When** the scheduled time arrives, **Then** they receive a reminder notification to complete the assessment
3. **Given** a user has set up multiple assessment schedules, **When** they view their schedule settings, **Then** they see all active schedules with their frequencies and next scheduled dates
4. **Given** a user wants to modify their routine, **When** they access a configured schedule, **Then** they can edit the frequency or disable the schedule

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user starts an assessment but doesn't complete it? Is progress saved as partial/incomplete, or discarded?
- How does the system handle a user trying to complete the same assessment multiple times in one day? Should this be allowed or prevented?
- What happens if a user deletes an activity that's associated with historical mood check-ins? (Addressed in User Story 3 - data integrity preserved)
- How does the system behave when there's insufficient data to generate meaningful charts? (e.g., only one data point)
- What happens if a user hasn't completed any assessments when they try to view trend charts?
- How should the system handle timezone changes for users who travel or move?
- What if a user wants to backdate an assessment or mood check-in they forgot to log?
- How should the system handle very long activity names or special characters in activity names?
