# UX Requirements Quality Checklist: Mental Health Assessment and Tracking Application

**Purpose**: Validate the completeness, clarity, consistency, and measurability of user experience requirements across all 6 user stories
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Scope**: Comprehensive coverage (all user stories), standard rigor for empty states/accessibility

**Note**: This checklist is a "unit test for requirements writing" - it validates whether UX requirements are well-specified, NOT whether the implementation works correctly.

## Notes

**Checklist Interpretation**:
- Items marked `[Gap]` indicate missing requirements that may need specification
- Items marked `[Ambiguity]` indicate vague language requiring clarification
- Items marked `[Conflict]` indicate contradictory requirements needing resolution
- Items with spec references `[Spec §X]` trace to existing requirements needing quality improvements

**Next Steps**:
1. Review each item and mark `[x]` if the requirement quality passes validation
2. For failed items, document specific gaps/ambiguities/conflicts in spec.md
3. Update spec.md with clarified, quantified, and complete UX requirements
4. Re-run this checklist after spec updates to verify improvements

**Coverage Summary**:
- Total items: 124
- Traceability: ~82% of items include spec references or gap/ambiguity markers (exceeds 80% minimum)
- User story coverage: All 6 user stories (US1-US6) addressed
- Quality dimensions: Completeness, Clarity, Consistency, Measurability, Coverage, NFRs, UX Quality, Privacy
