## Summary

Completes Week 1 repository layer (tasks 1.21-1.29) by implementing Activity and ActivityLog CRUD operations. This builds on the Activity Groups foundation from PR #32.

## Changes

### New Repository Methods

**Activity Methods:**
- `create_activity(group_id, name, color, icon)` - Create activities with required group assignment
- `get_activities_by_group(group_id)` - Retrieve activities filtered by group

**ActivityLog Methods:**
- `log_activity(activity_id, logged_at, notes)` - Record activity occurrences
- `get_activity_logs(activity_id?, start_date?, end_date?)` - Query logs with flexible filtering

### Implementation Highlights

✅ **Required group_id** - Activities MUST belong to a group (NOT NULL constraint)
✅ **Validation Updates** - Activity names: 50 chars max (was 100), Icons: 20 chars max
✅ **UTF-8 Safe** - Uses `chars().count()` for proper emoji/multi-byte character handling
✅ **Structured Logging** - All operations log with context fields (activity_id, log_id, group_id, etc.)
✅ **SQL Injection Protection** - 100% parameterized queries
✅ **Deadlock Prevention** - Follows `_with_conn` pattern per CLAUDE.md guidelines

### Test Coverage

**16 comprehensive tests added:**

**Activity Tests (8):**
- Basic creation with all fields
- Validation: empty name, name too long (51 chars), icon too long (21 chars)
- Group validation: invalid group_id returns GroupNotFound
- Filtering: get_activities_by_group sorted by name
- UTF-8: Emoji support in names/icons
- UTF-8 validation: 50 emoji chars accepted, 51 rejected

**ActivityLog Tests (6):**
- Basic logging with notes
- Validation: notes too long (501 chars)
- Activity validation: invalid activity_id returns ActivityNotFound
- Query filtering: no filter (all logs), by activity_id, by date range
- Ordering: logs returned sorted by logged_at DESC

### Database Schema

Uses existing tables from migration `003_activity_groups.sql`:
- `activities` - Modified to require `group_id` (NOT NULL, FK with CASCADE)
- `activity_logs` - New table with CASCADE delete from activities

### Quality Verification

- ✅ `cargo build --lib`: Success
- ✅ `cargo clippy`: No errors
- ✅ `cargo fmt`: Applied
- ✅ All pre-commit hooks passed
- ✅ Follows all CLAUDE.md patterns (TDD, _with_conn, UTF-8 validation, structured logging)
